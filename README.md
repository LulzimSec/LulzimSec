## Hi!
My name is Lulzim and I am currently a student at ITHS in Gothenburg where I am studying under the IT-Securityspecialist programe. In this portfolio I hope to share my different experiences and accomplishments while I go down the journey of IT.

As I go through my studies I will be working on labs to gain further, practical, knowledge. Which will then be shared in this portfolio.
